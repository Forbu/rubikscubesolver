Solviing rubik's cube with transformer world model

The idea is to use new architecture and RL algorithm around transformer and world model to solve rubik's cube.

Inspired from : 

- DO TRANSFORMER WORLD MODELS GIVE BETTER POLICY GRADIENTS ? (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05290)  

- TRANSFORMER-BASED WORLD MODELS ARE HAPPY WITH 100K INTERACTIONS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07109)
